### **R5 - Purpose & Scope:**

<br>

Overview:
- The schoolyard classic, '*Scissors, Paper, Rock*' was a great past-time before the smartphone era
- Kids used to engage with each other in a simple game of wits, fist-pumping the air for a chance at victory

Problem:

- With the introduction of smartphones and their ubiquitous adoption in moden schoolyards, a legacy is at risk of becoming antique 
- To combat this, I have undertaken arguably one of the most important tasks in gaming history... to digitise '*Scissors, Paper, Rock*'
- This alone won't be enough, however. To succeed, I have made the executive decision to rebrand the classic to appeal to a younger audience
- I give you: '*Sith-Lord, Jedi, Ewok*'

Target Audience:
- '*Sith-Lord, Jedi, Ewok*' is a game targeting younger audiences who may not have grown up playing '*Scissors, Paper, Rock*', but will also more broadly appeal to fans of the Star Wars franchise

Usage:
- Users of '*Sith-Lord, Jedi, Ewok*' will be given the option to play the rebranded classic against a computer player (AI) and save highscores for bragging rights amongst their friends
